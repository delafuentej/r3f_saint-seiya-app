# Saint Seiya Knights ‚Äî Shader Transitions Project

A **React Three Fiber** project inspired by the legendary anime **Saint Seiya (Knights of the Zodiac)**.

This project showcases **custom shader transitions** applied to 3D models of the characters, allowing smooth screen and model fade effects for cinematic scene changes.

## üìå Conclusion

We have learned how to create **custom transition effects** for both models and screens using shaders in React Three Fiber.

This opens up endless possibilities to design unique and creative transitions within your projects.

‚ú® Keep experimenting with different effects and shaders to craft the perfect visual experience for your users.  
Don‚Äôt rely on a single technique ‚Äî mix **motion, shaders, and other effects** to create a truly engaging and memorable experience.
